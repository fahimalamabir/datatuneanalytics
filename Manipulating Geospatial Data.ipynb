We refer to this way of joining data (by simpling matching values in the index) as an **attribute join**.\n\nWhen performing an attribute join with a GeoDataFrame, it's best to use the `gpd.GeoDataFrame.merge()`.

With a spatial join, we combine GeoDataFrames based on the spatial relationship between the objects in the \"geometry\" columns.

If a Point object from the `universities` GeoDataFrame intersects a Polygon object from the `europe` DataFrame, the corresponding rows are combined and added as a single row of the `european_universities` DataFrame.  Otherwise, countries without a matching university (and universities without a matching country) are omitted from the results.\n\nThe `gpd.sjoin()` method is customizable for different types of joins, through the `how` and `op` arguments.  For instance, you can do the equivalent of a SQL left (or right) join by setting `how='left'` (or `how='right'`).  We won't go into the details in this course, but you can learn more in [the documentation](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/reference/api/geopandas.sjoin.html).\n\n# Your turn\n\n**[Use geocoding and table joins](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels/fork/5832170)** to identify suitable locations for the next Starbucks Reserve Roastery.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?
